# If you like to create a translation, you do the following.
# - copy this file to a file with the two letter short for that language replacing "en".
# - also fill this two letter short in the lang variable below
# - replace the text strings with your language version, but:
#       - keep the '%' (%s, %d, etc) markers in place as they get replaced by things like the name of a file
#       - if there is an EOL '\n' at the end, leave it also in place, but also do not add your own
#       - however in some situations you can spread the text over multiple lines
#       - keep any indentations at the start
# - run this new created script to create the language file for your own use
# - send us this new created script and we probably include it with the language file in the package.
# - check regularly if you need to update the script, update the version and send us the updated version.

# There are a few special categories:
# -  In texts[u'config][u'help'] you should check that the output on the --help option does not excede a width of 80
#    Else use spaces and newlines to layout.
# -  In texts[u'config][u'confighelp'] there are several groups followed by empty lines. If empty they are not printed,
#    but you can use them if you need more space. e.g. 1 - 10, 11 - 16, 21 -  39, 41 - 52, 61 - 67, 71 - 77, 81 - 87, 91 - 139, ...
